Aspect Ratio
--aspect <width:height>
or --ar <width:height>

Popular Aspect Ratios
→
Change the aspect ratio of a generation. The default is 1:1 (square aspect ratio).


Chaos
--chaos <number 0-100>
or --c <number 0-100>
→
Changed how varied and unpredictable your results are. The default is 0.


Image Weight
--iw <0–2>
→
Sets the strength of the image prompt relative to text prompt, for when you're doing image-to-image generations.
The default value is 1. Setting this to 0 is the same as not using an image at all.


No
--no <anything you don't want>
→
Negative prompt, write what you don't want after. --no people removes people from a scene.


Style
--style <name of style>


Image Prompts (img2img)
<link to image>
→
One of Midjourney's most powerful and most underrated features.

Use the content and style of existing images to generate a new image.
You do this by including a link to the image in your prompt and writing the rest of the prompt as you normally would.


Multi Prompts & Prompt Weights
<concept 1>::<concept 1 weight>
<concept 2>::<concept 2 weight>

Prompt Weight Guide
Adding a :: between phrases is a hard break: this tells Midjourney "these are separate concepts".

You can add a number immediately after the double colon to assign the weight (relative importance) to that part of the prompt 
(if you don't add a number the weight is 1.


Permutation Prompts
{<idea 1>, <idea 2>}
Permutation Prompt Guide
Permutation Prompts allow you to quickly generate variations of a prompt with a single /imagine command.

Put lists of ideas separated with commas, within curly braces {} in your prompt

Example:
/imagine a {red, green, yellow} bird will produce 3 generations, and is the same as running:
/imagine a red bird
/imagine a green bird
/imagine a yellow bird
